    <h3>The team behind Sikho Punjabi</h3>
    <p>Hey! I'm Stephanie, and I built this app because I couldn't find another option that fit my needs. Primarily, I wanted an easy way to study punjabi so I can better communicate with my family. But also, it is a beautiful and fun language to learn! If you enjoy exploring new languages, or want to sharpen your own punjabi skills, you can sign-up to access over 300 free lessons in 10 organized units. I hope you find it useful! </p>
    <p>Special thanks to everyone who helped me bring this project to life: Justin Castilla, Kay Hudson, and all my friends from General Assembly.</p>
